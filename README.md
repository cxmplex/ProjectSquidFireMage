# ProjectSquidFireMage

- Dumped project squid fire mage (not by me) (and the other unfinished rotations like rogue), ported to minibot (now defunc) by me. 
- Fully deobfuscated including original comments in code.


- Ran by known scammers Xen (not real Xen either) and Larry.
- Exit scammed after EWT shutdown by pretending to have EWT source code .

- Full of hilariously bad code, especially anywhere you see "I'm a genius" in one of the comments.

Things you'll find hilarious

- Calls himself a genius for creating a caching layer on top of already cached functions
- Self-boasting April fools joke in which he saves the user from a fake GM
- Heavy copy pasting from Larry's scam rotations
- Magic numbers and logic for basically everything
- Massive rotation runner (why isn't this split into various components, who knows)
- Pointless reiteration of things like unitauras for the 50 million different checks he does (this is where you should have actually used proper caching)
- Perhaps the worst authentication ever made
- Laughable AOE circle prediction (often will place the edge of the AOE barely on the target instead of centering or predicting properly)
